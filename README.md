`additional` Other intermediate files used in the paper. 

- `LNCaP_back0_loops_longrange.txt.gz` HiChIP loops in longrange format viewable in https://epigenomegateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tracks.html#hic. 

<!--- `paintor_1causals.txt.gz` contains the results from fine-mapping using Paintor (1 causal) across 130 regions. --->
- `credsets95_paintor_1causals_137regions.txt.gz` contains the results from fine-mapping using Paintor (1 causal) across 137 regions. In the analyses we removed regions that did not reach P < 5*10^-8, and we replaced the fine-mapped results in two regions in the 8q24 (127.6â€“129.0Mb, "chr8.127849659.128199916.rs16901979,rs183373024,rs10086908,rs12543663", "chr8.128260673.128560038.rs1447295,rs620861,rs6983267") with 174 JAM fine-mapping (Supplementary Data 3 of Matejcic et al.) in region chr8.127600000.129000000.rs77541621
