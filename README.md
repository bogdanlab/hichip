Results
-------

`paintor_1causals.txt.gz` contains the results from fine-mapping using Paintor (1 causal) across 137 region. In the analyses we removed regions that did not reach P < 5*10^-8, and we replaced the fine-mapped results in two regions in the 8q24 (127.6â€“129.0Mb, "chr8.127849659.128199916.rs16901979,rs183373024,rs10086908,rs12543663", "chr8.128260673.128560038.rs1447295,rs620861,rs6983267") with JAM fine-mapping (Supplementary Data 3 of Matejcic et al.). 
`Thib_eGenes_bonf_bestSNP` contains the cis-eQTLs association statistics in Thibodeau.
`TCGA_eGenes_bonf_bestSNP` contains the cis-eQTLs association statistics in TCGA.
